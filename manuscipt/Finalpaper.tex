\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Since the dawn of cinema, a lot has evolved in terms of effects and sound design. 
Silent or black-and-white films are no longer common. However, there had been no
change in the variables that are used to predict revenues. The stars, directors,
authors, budget, corporation, rating, and scores are among those elements.With 
varying ratings and genres, movies are meant to amuse their viewers. However, 
the writers' and directors' perspectives on those films, together with the actors 
whose acting prowess transforms the director's vision into a live action, are what 
stimulates their interest in those films the most. That being said, movies deliver 
their viewers those things. The gross revenue, however, is what really matters 
most as it determines how well the film performed at the box office.

\section{Data}
\label{sec:data}

The data of this paper is taken from Kaggle \href{https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielgrijalvas/movies}. 
The data includes 6820 films from 1986 to 2016 (about 220 films annually). It has
fifteen features: budget, runtime (the amount of time the film is on screen), company 
or productions, country, director, genre, gross (the amount of money the film bringsin), 
name of the film, rating, date of release, IMDb ratings, votes, actors starring in the
film, year of release, and writers. I will also be analyzing the variables that affect
gross revenue in this paper by concentrating on the directors, stars, scores, and budget.

regression mode, I converted the non munerical columns to NA or  As the data contain
numerical data that is score, budget, votes, runtime and non munerical data that are
